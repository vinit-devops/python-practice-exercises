Question 1 -
Write a Python program to print the version of Python currently being used.

Question 2 -
Ravi is an aspiring professional gamer who tracks his performance in each game he plays throughout a season. 
    He wants to know how many times he beats his personal best and worst scores during the season. 
    His first game's score sets the initial record. Every time he scores higher than his highest so far, it's a new "high score". 
    Every time he scores lower than his lowest so far, it's a new "low score".
Write a function to calculate how many times Ravi sets new high and low score records during the season.
  Input:
    n: Integer — total number of games played.
    scores: List of integers — Ravi’s scores for each game, in order.
  Output:
     Return a list with two integers:
     Index 0: Number of times Ravi broke his highest score record.
     Index 1: Number of times Ravi broke his lowest score record.
  Constraints:
     1 <= n <= 1000
     0 <= scores[i] <= 10^8
